2. Open in Unity 
3. Open the `Universe` scene located in `Assets/Scenes`.
4. If you only wish to run the code in Unity, click the run button and stop here. Make sure the Maximize on Play option is checked.
5. Go to `File->Build Settings` and click Add Open Scenes. `Scenes/Universe` should now appear in the Scenes in Build list.
6. Click build and select the output folder. The recommended folder is `Build`.
